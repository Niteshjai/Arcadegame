**[A] Maze Game:**

Introduction
This is a simple maze game implemented in C programming language. The player navigates through a maze from the start ('B') to the finish ('F') position using keyboard controls.

Instructions
Controls: Use the 'W', 'S', 'A', 'D' keys to move the player character ('B') up, down, left, and right, respectively.
Objective: Reach the finish position ('F') in the maze.
Wall Representation:
Walls are represented by '#'.
The player character is represented by 'B'.
The finish position is represented by 'F'.
Empty spaces are represented by blank spaces (' ').
Gameplay: The maze is generated randomly, and the player must navigate through it to reach the finish. The maze is displayed on the console, and the player's progress is shown in real-time.


**How to Play**
Enter the size of the maze when prompted. Ensure that the size is greater than 4.
Use the 'W', 'S', 'A', 'D' keys to navigate through the maze.
Reach the finish position ('F') to complete the maze.


Customization
You can adjust the size of the maze by entering a different size when prompted.
Modify the wall representation or player character if desired.
Adjust the keyboard controls to your preference.

Dependencies
This game requires a C compiler to compile and run the code.
For Windows users, the windows.h library is used for system-specific functions. Adjustments may be needed for other platforms.

The game ends when either the player reaches the 2048 tile (win) or no more moves are possible (game over).



**[D]Snake Game :**

Introduction
This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in C programming language. The game utilizes the console for display and interaction.

Controls

The game ends when the snake cannot move further.
Customization
You can adjust the size of the game board by modifying the row and col macros in the code.


Dependencies
This game requires a C compiler to compile and run the code.
For Windows users, the windows.h library is used for system-specific functions. Adjustments may be needed for other platforms.
